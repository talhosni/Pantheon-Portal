# Pantheon Portal

Pantheon Portal is a fictional software project where the gods of Mount Olympus collaborate using Git. Each branch represents a unique feature contributed by a mythological figure, resulting in realistic Git scenarios including branching, merge conflicts, and rebasing.

This project was designed as a learning exercise to demonstrate advanced Git workflows in a creative and practical way.

## Project Overview

Pantheon Portal simulates a divine task management platform used by the Olympian gods. Contributions are made via individual feature branches, resulting in intentional conflicts and messy histories that are resolved using professional Git techniques.

## Branch Descriptions

- `main` – The central, stable codebase
- `zeus-ui-theme` – Zeus adds a thunderbolt-themed UI update
- `poseidon-water-widget` – Poseidon adds a water widget and modifies the UI, causing a conflict
- `hermes-analytics` – Hermes commits analytics features in rapid succession (later squashed)

## Git Skills Demonstrated

- Structured branching and naming strategies
- Merge conflict detection and resolution
- Interactive rebase for commit history cleanup
- Pull request creation and force pushing rebased branches
- Best practices for commit message formatting and history clarity

## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of practical Git proficiency, including version control strategies, collaboration simulation, and conflict management using the command line. The scenario is fictional, but the workflows mirror real-world development practices.

## Repository Structure

- `config.py` – Simulated configuration file modified by Zeus and Poseidon
- `features.py` – Water widget implementation
- `analytics.py` – Hermes’s analytics tracking module
